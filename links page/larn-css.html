        <h1>Learning CSS</h1>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written
            in HTML or XML. It allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of a
            website. CSS provides the ability to create visually appealing and responsive web pages by separating
            content from design. It supports various styling options, including positioning, animations, and
            transformations. By using selectors and properties, you can target specific HTML elements and apply styles
            to them. CSS also enables the use of media queries to create adaptive designs for different devices and
            screen sizes.</p>
