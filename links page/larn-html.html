        <h1>Learning HTML</h1>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of web development, used to create the structure and
            content
            of web pages. It consists of tags that define different elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links,
            and
            more. Learning HTML involves understanding how these tags work together to create a cohesive web page
            layout.
            It's essential for anyone interested in building websites to grasp HTML as it forms the basis for web
            development alongside CSS and JavaScript. By mastering HTML, you gain the ability to structure and present
            content effectively on the web.</p>
